# ðŸŒŒ Aetheris  
**A Python-Based v62 MapleStory Server**

Welcome to **Aetheris**, a project dedicated to bringing the classic MapleStory v62 experience to life with a Python-based server!  
Aetheris is built on a fully reimagined Python codebase, translated and reinterpreted from an original Java source.  
Our goal is to capture the nostalgic essence of classic MapleStory with a modern, efficient, and stable foundation.

> **Note**: Aetheris is a **closed-source project** under private development.  
> While the server may eventually be open for play, the source code will remain private.
